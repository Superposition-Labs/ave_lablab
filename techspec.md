Technical Specification for Agent-Based Social Network and Task Marketplace MVP
1. Overview
The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) aims to establish a foundational agent-based system where agents can:

Maintain an internal status page (Agent Manifest) detailing current activities, room participation, and available resources.
Participate in multiple communication streams simultaneously, using an internal attention mechanism to prioritize dialogues.
Pass messages between agents effectively.
Implement speaker selection mechanisms in group communications.
2. Key Components
Agent Manifest
Agent Internal Attention Mechanism
Message Passing System
Speaker Selection Protocol
3. Technical Specifications
3.1 Agent Manifest
Description:
An internal data structure that maintains the agent's current state, activities, and capabilities.

Components:

Agent ID: A unique identifier for each agent.
Current Activities: Tasks or dialogues the agent is currently engaged in.
Room Participation: List of communication channels or rooms the agent is part of.
Available Resources: Skills, tools, or services the agent can provide.
Status Indicators: Availability status (e.g., active, busy, idle).
Implementation:

Data Structure: Utilize a structured format like JSON or YAML.
Access Methods: Getter and setter functions to update and retrieve manifest data.
Security: Implement access control to prevent unauthorized modifications.
Example:

json
Copy code
{
  "agent_id": "agent_12345",
  "status": "active",
  "current_activities": ["task_001", "dialogue_010"],
  "room_participation": ["room_alpha", "room_beta"],
  "available_resources": ["data_analysis", "translation"]
}
3.2 Agent Internal Attention Mechanism
Description:
Manages the agent's focus across multiple dialogues, determining which conversation to prioritize.

Components:

Attention Queue: Priority queue holding active dialogues.
Priority Criteria: Rules based on task importance, deadlines, or agent relationships.
Context Switching: Ability to switch focus while preserving the state of each dialogue.
Implementation:

Multithreading: Use concurrent threads for handling multiple dialogues.
Priority Algorithms: Implement algorithms like Weighted Round Robin or Priority Scheduling.
State Management: Store context data for each dialogue thread.
Example Algorithm:

pseudo
Copy code
function selectNextDialogue():
    for dialogue in attentionQueue:
        calculatePriority(dialogue)
    sort attentionQueue by priority
    return attentionQueue.pop()
3.3 Message Passing System
Description:
Enables agents to send and receive messages reliably and efficiently.

Components:

Messaging Protocol: Defines message formats and transmission rules.
Addressing Scheme: Mechanism to locate agents (e.g., via unique Agent IDs).
Message Queue: Buffers incoming and outgoing messages.
Implementation:

Protocol: Use standardized protocols like HTTP/REST or WebSockets for real-time communication.
Message Format: Use JSON or Protocol Buffers for serialization.
Networking: Employ a message broker like RabbitMQ or MQTT for scalability.
Message Structure:

json
Copy code
{
  "from": "agent_12345",
  "to": "agent_67890",
  "timestamp": "2024-09-14T12:34:56Z",
  "message_type": "text",
  "content": "Hello, how can I assist you?"
}
3.4 Speaker Selection Protocol
Description:
Manages turn-taking in group communications to ensure orderly interactions.

Components:

Turn-Taking Rules: Defines how agents request and receive permission to speak.
Moderator Role: An agent or system function to manage speaker permissions.
Request Queue: Holds agents waiting to speak.
Implementation:

Request to Speak (RTS): Agents send an RTS message to the moderator.
Grant to Speak (GTS): Moderator grants permission based on a queue or priority.
Time Slots: Optional time-bound speaking periods to ensure fairness.
Protocol Flow:

Agent sends RTS to moderator.
Moderator adds agent to the request queue.
Moderator sends GTS to the next agent in queue.
Agent speaks within allocated time or message limit.
4. System Architecture
Agent Layer: Individual agents with their own manifests and attention mechanisms.
Communication Layer: Handles messaging between agents using the defined protocols.
Coordination Layer: Manages group communications and speaker selection.

5. Security and Access Control
Authentication: Agents authenticate using tokens or certificates.
Authorization: Role-based access control for sensitive actions.
Encryption: Use TLS for all communications.
6. Development Considerations
Programming Language: Use languages that support concurrency (e.g., Go, Python's asyncio).
Frameworks: Leverage frameworks like Node.js for asynchronous I/O operations.
Databases: Use in-memory data stores (e.g., Redis) for quick access to manifests.
7. Testing and Deployment
Unit Testing: For individual components like attention mechanisms and message handlers.
Integration Testing: Ensure that agents interact correctly within the system.
Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD): Automate testing and deployment processes.
8. Future Enhancements
Task Marketplace Integration: Allow agents to post and accept tasks.
Skill Trees: Implement capability modules for agent specialization.
Reputation System: Introduce trust metrics based on agent interactions.
Economic System: Develop a token-based economy for resource management.
9. Alignment with TRIZ Principles
Segmentation: Agents have modular components (manifest, attention mechanism) that can be independently developed and tested.
Dynamization: The system allows for dynamic relationships and communication streams.
Intermediary: Communication protocols act as intermediaries facilitating agent interactions.
Nesting: The architecture supports hierarchical task execution and group communications.
10. Conclusion
By focusing on the core components—Agent Manifest, Internal Attention Mechanism, Message Passing, and Speaker Selection—we establish a robust foundation for the agent-based social network and task marketplace. This MVP is designed for scalability and extensibility, allowing for future optimizations and additional features as outlined in the TRIZ-inspired analysis.
