            We are on a tipping point. 
            Human decisions are becoming suboptimal.
            Our potential for evolution is bounded by biological constraints.
            We have to cede the economic control to our descendents: autonomous agents.
            What are autonomous economic agents? They are our representatives in the new economy.
            They are agents that are able to engage in economic relationships with each other without human intervention.
            The higher level intentions that describe their behaviour of such agents can be controlled by human entity or other agents.
            Agents can execute functions specified by other agents. They have their own agenda. 
            We will interface with the network just as we interface with the computer â€” without thinking of how and by what means
            it achieves our goal. 
            
            Already today it's hard to put human labour to the same scale as agent's. We see copilots replacing tens of thousands 
            of low and intermediate skill workers in the space of software engineering. It doesn't mean that all software has
            been engineered already. Just that the quality of computer generated code has gone significanly higher and it's price
            was reduced to the price of compute. People simply cannot compete with robots in such areas as fast movement, precise 
            calculations, parallel processing and now, code generation (at least when we're talking about tasks that are trivial 
            and repetitive, which is by definition most of them).

            Fast forward a couple of years in the future and even the smallest models will be comparable to the average human 
            in capabilities like construction of small projects, blocks combination and assembly of parts of the systems.
            The information architects at the top of the design team will of course save their jobs for the time being, after all
            it's only simple LLMs that replace them, not some somphisticated AGI or superintelligent Q* with reasoning capabilities.
            So it must be humbling to know that most of human labour is actually replaced by a couple of thousand of transformer layers
            and a 3-billion parameter model run from a smartphone.

            So, countless armies of humans will be left without work. Some of them will find jobs and adapt, others will be absorbed by the market possibly on lower-wage roles.
